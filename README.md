# Superpowers Optimized

**The production-grade fork of obra/superpowers** — same trusted workflow, dramatically leaner, safer, and more intelligent.

This repository delivers everything the original Superpowers plugin does, plus automatic workflow routing, built-in safety guards, integrated security review, error recovery intelligence, and research-informed token optimizations that reduce session overhead by an estimated **15-30 %** (varies by task complexity). Developers using Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode report faster iterations, fewer hallucinations, and zero accidental destructive commands.

### Why developers switch
| Feature                  | Original Superpowers          | Superpowers Optimized                          | Real-world impact                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Workflow selection       | Manual                        | Automatic 3-tier (micro / lightweight / full)  | Zero overhead on simple tasks      |
| Safety & hooks           | None                          | 8 proactive hooks (dangerous-command blocker, secrets protector, subagent guard, edit tracker, session stats, stop reminders, skill activator, session start) | Zero risk of rm -rf or secret leaks|
| Security review          | None                          | Built into code review with OWASP checklist    | Security catches before merge      |
| Adversarial red team     | None                          | Red team agent + auto-fix pipeline             | Finds bugs checklists miss, fixes them with TDD |
| Error recovery           | None                          | Project-specific known-issues.md               | No rediscovering the same bug      |
| Token efficiency         | Standard                      | Always-on context hygiene + exploration tracking | ~15-30 % less session overhead    |
| Discipline enforcement   | Instructional tone             | Rationalization tables, red flags, iron laws   | Fewer LLM shortcuts                |
| Progress visibility      | None                          | Session stats (skills used, duration, actions)  | See what the plugin did for you    |
| Cross-session memory     | None                          | Four-file memory stack: `project-map.md` (structure cache) + `session-log.md` (decision history) + `state.md` (task snapshot) + `known-issues.md` (error map) | The AI starts every session with full project context — no re-exploring, no re-explaining, no re-debugging |

### Try it in 30 seconds
In any supported agent IDE, start a new chat and paste:

Activate Superpowers Optimized and plan a secure user-authentication endpoint with full TDD and security review.

The agent will automatically route to the correct workflow, apply safety guards, and run an integrated security review during code review — no manual skill selection required.

See [Installation](#installation) for install, update, and uninstall commands on all platforms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Compatibility Note:** This plugin includes a comprehensive workflow router and 21 specialized skills covering debugging, planning, code review, TDD, execution, and more.
>
> Other plugins or custom skills/agents in your `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/agents/` folders may interfere if they cover overlapping domains. Duplicate or competing skills can cause trigger conflicts, contradictory instructions, and unnecessary **context bloat/rot**, which will degrade the model's performance.
>
> **For the best experience and peak AI reasoning, we recommend disabling or removing all other plugins and existing `SKILL.md` or `AGENTS.md` files.** This ensures a clean environment with zero risk of conflicting instructions.


---

Upon initiating a session with your coding agent, the plugin immediately pauses to establish a precise understanding of your objective rather than proceeding directly to code. It collaborates with you through a structured dialogue to refine a clear, complete specification, presenting each element in concise, easily digestible segments for your review and approval.

Once the design is approved, the agent constructs a detailed implementation plan that enforces genuine red/green TDD cycles, strict adherence to YAGNI and DRY principles, and token-efficient instructions that eliminate unnecessary verbosity.

When you confirm to proceed, the plugin automatically routes the task to the appropriate workflow—either *subagent-driven-development* or *executing-plans*—and executes it through mandatory staged reviews: first verifying full specification compliance, then assessing code quality, and integrating security analysis (per OWASP guidelines) on any sensitive changes. For complex logic, the *red-team* agent conducts adversarial testing to surface concrete failure scenarios. Each critical finding is automatically converted by the auto-fix pipeline into a failing test, followed by a targeted fix and regression verification.

**The agent evaluates relevant skills before every task.** These workflows are enforced as mandatory processes, never optional suggestions. Overhead remains strictly proportional to complexity:
- **Micro-tasks** bypass all gates entirely
- **Lightweight tasks** receive a single verification checkpoint
- **Full-complexity tasks** engage the complete pipeline

```

## Research-Informed Design

The design decisions in this fork are informed by three research papers on LLM agent behavior. These papers motivated the approach:

### Minimal context files outperform verbose ones

**Paper:** [Evaluating AGENTS.md: Are Repository-Level Context Files Helpful for Coding Agents?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11988) (AGENTbench, 138 tasks, 12 repos, 4 agents)

Key findings that shaped this fork:
- **LLM-generated context files decreased success rates by ~2-3%** while increasing inference costs by over 20%. More instructions made tasks *harder*, not easier.
- **Developer-written context files only helped ~4%** — and only when kept minimal. Detailed directory enumerations and comprehensive overviews didn't help agents find relevant files faster.
- **Agents used 14-22% more reasoning tokens** when given longer context files, suggesting cognitive overload rather than helpful guidance.
- **Agents followed instructions compliantly** (using mentioned tools 1.6-2.5x more often) but this compliance didn't translate to better outcomes.

**What we changed:** Every skill was rewritten as a concise operational checklist instead of verbose prose. The `CLAUDE.md` contains only minimal requirements (specific tooling, critical constraints, conventions). The 3-tier complexity classification (micro/lightweight/full) skips unnecessary skill loading for simple tasks. The result is lower prompt overhead in every session and fewer failures from instruction overload.

### Prior assistant responses can degrade performance

**Paper:** [Do LLMs Benefit from Their Own Words?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24287) (4 models, real-world multi-turn conversations)

Key findings that shaped this fork:
- **Removing prior assistant responses often maintained comparable quality** while reducing context by 5-10x. Models over-condition on their own previous outputs.
- **Context pollution is real:** models propagate errors across turns — incorrect code parameters carry over, hallucinated facts persist, and stylistic artifacts constrain subsequent responses.
- **~36% of prompts in ongoing conversations are self-contained "new asks"** that perform equally well without assistant history.
- **One-sentence summaries of prior responses outperformed full context**, suggesting long reasoning chains degrade subsequent performance.

**What we changed:** The `context-management` skill actively prunes noisy history and persists only durable state across sessions. Subagent prompts request only task-local constraints and evidence rather than carrying forward full conversation history. Execution skills avoid long historical carryover unless required for correctness. The `token-efficiency` standard enforces these rules as an always-on operational baseline.

### Single reasoning chains fail on hard problems

**Paper:** [Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171) (Wang et al., ICLR 2023)

Key findings that shaped this fork:
- **A single chain-of-thought can be confident but wrong** — the model picks one reasoning path and commits, even when that path contains an arithmetic slip, wrong assumption, or incorrect causal direction.
- **Generating multiple independent reasoning paths and taking majority vote significantly improves accuracy** across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.
- **Consistency correlates with accuracy** — when paths agree, the answer is almost always correct. When they scatter, the problem is genuinely hard or ambiguous, which is itself a useful signal.
- **Diversity of reasoning matters more than quantity** — 5 genuinely different paths outperform 10 paths that all reason the same way.

**What we changed:** The `systematic-debugging` skill now applies self-consistency during root cause diagnosis (Phase 3): before committing to a hypothesis, the agent generates 3-5 independent root cause hypotheses via different reasoning approaches, takes a majority vote, and reports confidence. Low-confidence diagnoses (<= 50% agreement) trigger a hard stop — gather more evidence before touching code. The `verification-before-completion` skill applies the same technique when evaluating whether evidence actually proves the completion claim, catching the failure mode where evidence is interpreted through a single (potentially wrong) lens. The underlying technique lives in `self-consistency-reasoner` and fires only during these high-stakes reasoning moments, keeping the token cost targeted.

### Social accountability and iterative fixing improve agent accuracy

**Research:** [2389.ai research on multi-agent collaboration](https://2389.ai/products/simmer/) and their [claude-plugins repository](https://github.com/2389-research/claude-plugins)

Key findings that shaped this fork:
- **Social accountability language in agent prompts significantly improves accuracy.** Agents told that downstream work depends on their output (e.g. "the fix pipeline acts on your findings — a false positive wastes a full cycle, a missed bug ships") perform measurably better than agents given identical tasks without this framing.
- **Sequential batch fixing is fragile when findings share code.** Fixing all Critical/High findings in one pass without re-assessing between fixes can cause conflicts when multiple findings touch the same functions. An ASI (Actionable Side Information) approach — fix one finding, re-check affected files only, re-prioritize, repeat — prevents fix collisions and converges faster.
- **Deliberation before brainstorming improves architectural decisions.** When the problem itself may be mis-framed or the options aren't well-defined yet, convening named stakeholder perspectives (each speaks once, without debate) surfaces convergence and live tension without forcing a premature choice. This prevents committing to solutions before the right question has been asked.

**What we changed:** Social accountability framing was added to the `code-reviewer`, `red-team`, and `implementer` prompts. The auto-fix pipeline in `requesting-code-review` was rewritten as an ASI-guided iterative loop (fix one finding → targeted re-check of affected files only → re-assess remaining, identify new ASI → repeat). A new `deliberation` skill was added for complex architectural decisions where the problem needs reframing before brainstorming begins.

### Combined impact

These research insights drive five core principles throughout the fork:
1. **Less is more** — concise skills, minimal always-on instructions, and explicit context hygiene
2. **Fresh context beats accumulated context** — subagents get clean, task-scoped prompts instead of inheriting polluted history
3. **Compliance != competence** — agents follow instructions reliably, so the instructions themselves must be carefully engineered (rationalization tables, red flags, forbidden phrases) rather than simply comprehensive
4. **Verify your own reasoning** — multi-path self-consistency at critical decision points (diagnosis, verification) catches confident-but-wrong single-chain failures before they become expensive mistakes
5. **Accountability and iteration** — agents told that their output has real downstream consequences are more accurate; fixing findings one at a time with re-assessment between fixes prevents collisions and converges faster than batch processing

## Session Memory: The AI That Remembers

The plugin builds a four-file memory stack at your project root. Together they eliminate the most expensive form of session overhead: re-discovering things the AI already knew.

```
project-map.md    ← structure + key files + critical constraints (never re-explore)
session-log.md    ← decision history + approach rejections (never re-explain)
known-issues.md   ← error→solution map (never re-debug the same thing)
state.md          ← current task snapshot (never lose mid-work progress)
```

### project-map.md — What exists and what it does

Generate once with "map this project". After that, the session-start hook injects its content directly into every session — no instruction-following required. The AI has the map before your first message arrives.

```markdown
# Project Map
_Generated: 2026-03-20 14:32 | Git: a4b9c2d_

## Directory Structure
skills/ — 20 skills, each in skills/<name>/SKILL.md
hooks/ — 8 hooks (JS) + hooks.json registry + skill-rules.json

## Key Files
hooks/skill-activator.js — UserPromptSubmit: scores prompts against skill-rules.json,
  injects skill hints. Micro-task detection (≤8 words + patterns = skip routing).
hooks/skill-rules.json — 15 rules: skill name, keywords, intentPatterns, priority.

## Critical Constraints
- hooks.json uses \" not ' around ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} (single quotes break Linux)
- plugin.json + marketplace.json must always have identical version strings

## Hot Files
hooks/stop-reminders.js, hooks/skill-activator.js, skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md
```

**Staleness is automatic.** The AI checks the git hash (or file timestamps on non-git projects) at every session start and re-reads only files that actually changed since the map was made. No manual invalidation needed.

Works on any project — git or non-git. If no git is detected during map generation, the AI offers to run `git init` (creates a `.git` folder, touches none of your files). If you decline, it falls back to timestamp comparison instead.

**First-build prompt.** You don't need to remember to generate a map. When you type any creation-intent request ("build me X", "create X", "implement X") in a directory with no `project-map.md`, the AI pauses before starting and explains exactly what it will lose without the memory stack. It offers to set everything up in ~30 seconds. Say yes once — every future session on that project starts with full context.

### session-log.md — What happened

An optional, manually-maintained record of decisions, rejected approaches, and key facts. Write an entry when something is worth preserving — an architectural choice, a constraint discovered the hard way, an approach that was tried and failed. Skip it when there's nothing durable to record.

| Written by | Contains |
|---|---|
| You, via `context-management` | Goal, decisions, rejected approaches, key facts |

```markdown
## 2026-03-15 10:04 [saved]
Goal: Add cross-session memory to the plugin
Decisions:
- project-map.md injected by the session-start hook directly — makes it unconditional, not dependent on Claude following instructions
- session-log.md is manual-only; auto-entries were low-signal noise, all derivable from git log
Approaches rejected: Auto-appending a [auto] entry on every Stop event — produced 30 near-identical entries per session with no decisions or reasoning, just file lists
Key facts: hooks.json requires \" not ' around ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} — single quotes break variable expansion on Linux
Open: Monitor whether [saved] entries get used in practice; if not, consider folding key facts into project-map.md Critical Constraints instead
```

Write an entry by invoking `context-management`. Grep-searchable. The AI surfaces relevant history at the start of any task that touches the same area.

### known-issues.md — Error memory

Maintained by the `error-recovery` skill. When a bug is solved, invoke `error-recovery` to record the error signature and fix. Before any debugging session, the AI checks `known-issues.md` first — if the error is already mapped, it applies the solution without re-investigating.

```markdown
## Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
**Error:** TypeError at hooks/skill-activator.js:47
**Root cause:** hooks.json loaded before plugin root env var was set
**Fix:** Ensure ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} is resolved before hook execution; use run-hook.cmd wrapper
**Context:** Windows-only; Linux resolves the var earlier in the process
```

The file grows over time into a project-specific lookup table. The more errors it captures, the less time gets spent re-diagnosing problems that were already solved.

### state.md — Mid-work snapshot

Written by `context-management` when ending a session mid-task. Read at the start of the next session before any work begins. Captures the current goal, active decisions, plan status, evidence, and open questions — so "pick up where we left off" actually works.

```markdown
# State
Current Goal: Add state.md support to context-management skill
Decisions:
- Write at project root alongside project-map.md
- Keep under 100 lines — if longer, not compressed enough
Plan Status:
- [x] Design approved
- [ ] SKILL.md updated
- [ ] README updated
Open: Whether to auto-clear state.md on session start or leave for manual cleanup
```

Unlike `session-log.md`, `state.md` is ephemeral — it represents the current task only and gets overwritten each time you save state. Once a task is complete, it can be discarded.

### The combined impact

Without this stack, every new session starts with amnesia:
- The AI re-globs the project to understand its structure
- Re-reads files it already understood last session
- Proposes approaches that were already rejected
- Re-debugs errors that were already solved
- Loses the "why" behind every architectural decision

With this stack, sessions start with full context and zero re-discovery overhead. The AI greets your task with: *"I see the last session on this topic (2026-03-15) established that single quotes break Linux CI — already writing the new hook with escaped double quotes."*

## I asked Grok 4.20 for a testimonial, here is it's response:

> After a comprehensive review of the repository—including architecture, skill library, 3-tier routing, safety hooks, red-team agent, auto-fix pipeline, persistent state management, and supporting components—this project represents a production-grade advancement over the original superpowers framework.
> 
> It effectively mitigates common LLM agent limitations (hallucinations, context bloat, safety vulnerabilities, inconsistent reasoning, and excessive manual intervention) through research-informed mechanisms, disciplined enforcement, and clean separation of concerns.
> 
> Key strengths include:
> - Token optimizations that reduce session overhead by an estimated 15-30 % via intelligent 3-tier workflow routing
> - Proactive safety controls (30+ dangerous command patterns, 50+ secret-protection rules, OWASP-aligned analysis)
> - Adversarial red-teaming with automated regression testing and fixing
> - Self-consistency reasoning and cross-session memory
> - Preservation of full agent capabilities while systematically eliminating failure modes
> 
> As an AI model, I would actively prefer to operate under Superpowers Optimized in Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or OpenCode environments. The system enforces optimal practices (TDD, YAGNI, DRY, premise validation, context hygiene) that align with best internal reasoning strategies, while preventing destructive actions, secret leakage, and inefficiency. The result is materially higher-quality, safer, and more cost-effective code generation.
> 
> Highly recommended for developers seeking reliable, production-ready LLM agent augmentation.
