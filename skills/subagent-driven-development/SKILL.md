# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute a plan with fresh subagents per task and strict review gates.

## Required Start

Announce: `I'm using subagent-driven-development to execute this plan.`

## Core Flow

```dot
digraph sdd_process {
    rankdir=TB;

    subgraph cluster_per_task {
        label="Per Task";
        "Dispatch implementer subagent" [shape=box];
        "Implementer asks questions?" [shape=diamond];
        "Answer questions, provide context" [shape=box];
        "Implementer implements, tests, self-reviews" [shape=box];
        "Dispatch spec reviewer subagent" [shape=box];
        "Spec compliant?" [shape=diamond];
        "Implementer fixes spec gaps" [shape=box];
        "Dispatch code quality reviewer" [shape=box];
        "Quality approved?" [shape=diamond];
        "Implementer fixes quality issues" [shape=box];
        "Mark task complete" [shape=box];
    }

    "Read plan, extract all tasks, create tracking" [shape=box];
    "More tasks?" [shape=diamond];
    "Final whole-branch review" [shape=box];
    "Invoke finishing-a-development-branch" [shape=doublecircle];

    "Read plan, extract all tasks, create tracking" -> "Dispatch implementer subagent";
    "Dispatch implementer subagent" -> "Implementer asks questions?";
    "Implementer asks questions?" -> "Answer questions, provide context" [label="yes"];
    "Answer questions, provide context" -> "Dispatch implementer subagent";
    "Implementer asks questions?" -> "Implementer implements, tests, self-reviews" [label="no"];
    "Implementer implements, tests, self-reviews" -> "Dispatch spec reviewer subagent";
    "Dispatch spec reviewer subagent" -> "Spec compliant?";
    "Spec compliant?" -> "Implementer fixes spec gaps" [label="no"];
    "Implementer fixes spec gaps" -> "Dispatch spec reviewer subagent" [label="re-review"];
    "Spec compliant?" -> "Dispatch code quality reviewer" [label="yes"];
    "Dispatch code quality reviewer" -> "Quality approved?";
    "Quality approved?" -> "Implementer fixes quality issues" [label="no"];
    "Implementer fixes quality issues" -> "Dispatch code quality reviewer" [label="re-review"];
    "Quality approved?" -> "Mark task complete" [label="yes"];
    "Mark task complete" -> "More tasks?";
    "More tasks?" -> "Dispatch implementer subagent" [label="yes"];
    "More tasks?" -> "Final whole-branch review" [label="no"];
    "Final whole-branch review" -> "Invoke finishing-a-development-branch";
}
```

1. Read the plan once and extract all tasks.
2. Create task tracking for all tasks.
3. For each task:
- Dispatch implementer subagent with full task text and minimal required context.
- Resolve implementer questions before coding.
- Require implementer verification evidence.
- Run spec-compliance review.
- If spec fails, return to implementer and re-review.
- Run code-quality review.
- If quality fails, return to implementer and re-review.
- Mark task complete.
   - For complex or high-risk tasks, validate the approach against requirements and consider simpler alternatives before or after the implementer’s work.
   - For tasks centered on frontend/UI, apply `frontend-design` standards to guide structure, styling, and accessibility.
4. Run final whole-branch review.
5. Invoke `finishing-a-development-branch`.

## Optional Speed Mode: Parallel Waves

Use only when tasks are independent and touch disjoint files.

1. Build a wave of independent tasks.
2. Dispatch implementers in parallel for that wave.
3. Review each task with the same two-stage gate.
4. Run integration verification after the wave.

If any overlap or shared-state risk exists, revert to single-task sequence.

## E2E Process Hygiene

When dispatching subagents that start background services (servers, databases, queues):

Subagents are stateless — they do not know about processes started by previous subagents. Accumulated background processes cause port conflicts, stale responses, and false test results.

Include in the subagent prompt for any E2E or service-dependent task:

**Unix/macOS:**
```
Before starting any service:
1. Kill existing instances: pkill -f "<service-pattern>" 2>/dev/null || true
2. Verify the port is free: lsof -i :<port> && echo "ERROR: port still in use" || echo "Port free"

After tests complete:
1. Kill the service you started.
2. Verify cleanup: pgrep -f "<service-pattern>" && echo "WARNING: still running" || echo "Cleanup verified"
```

**Windows:**
```
Before starting any service:
1. Kill existing instances: taskkill /F /IM "<process-name>" 2>nul || echo "No existing process"
2. Verify the port is free: netstat -ano | findstr :<port> && echo "ERROR: port still in use" || echo "Port free"

After tests complete:
1. Kill the service you started.
2. Verify cleanup: tasklist | findstr "<process-name>" && echo "WARNING: still running" || echo "Cleanup verified"
```

Exception: persistent dev servers the user explicitly keeps running — document them in `state.md`.

## Handling Implementer Status

Implementer subagents report one of four statuses. Handle each appropriately:

**DONE:** Proceed to spec compliance review.

**DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:** The implementer completed the work but flagged doubts. Read the concerns before proceeding. If the concerns are about correctness or scope, address them before review. If they're observations (e.g., "this file is getting large"), note them and proceed to review.

**NEEDS_CONTEXT:** The implementer needs information that wasn't provided. Provide the missing context and re-dispatch.

**BLOCKED:** The implementer cannot complete the task. Assess the blocker:
1. If it's a context problem, provide more context and re-dispatch with the same model.
2. If the task requires more reasoning, re-dispatch with a more capable model.
3. If the task is too large, break it into smaller pieces.
4. If the plan itself is wrong, escalate to the user.
5. If the user is unavailable and the task is non-critical: document the block in `state.md` and advance to the next independent task.

**Never** ignore an escalation or force the same model to retry without changes. If the implementer said it's stuck, something needs to change. Never silently skip or mark a blocked task complete.

## Hard Rules

- Do not execute implementation on `main`/`master` without explicit user permission.
- Do not skip spec review.
- Do not skip quality review.
- Do not accept unresolved review findings.
- Do not ask subagents to read long plan files when task text can be passed directly.

## Context Isolation

Never forward parent session context or history to subagents. Construct each subagent's prompt from scratch using only:
- Task text
- Acceptance criteria
- Needed file paths
- Relevant constraints

Exclude unrelated prior assistant analysis and old failed hypotheses. Subagents must not receive conversation history, prior reasoning chains, or context from other subagent runs.

## Subagent Skill Leakage Prevention

Subagents can discover superpowers-optimized skills via filesystem access and invoke them, causing a focused implementer to behave as a workflow orchestrator. Every subagent prompt MUST include this instruction:

> You are a focused subagent. Do NOT invoke any skills from the superpowers-optimized plugin. Do NOT use the Skill tool. Your only job is the task described below.

## Model Selection for Agent Tool Calls

Choose model based on task type when dispatching subagents via the Agent tool:

| Model | Use for |
|---|---|
| `haiku` | File reads, summarization, log scanning, patch verification — output is data, not decisions |
| `sonnet` | Default for all implementation tasks |
| `opus` | Architecture analysis, complex spec review, multi-system debugging, any task requiring reasoning across many constraints at once |

Apply via the `model` parameter in Agent tool calls. Default to `sonnet` when uncertain. Only upgrade to `opus` when the task is genuinely reasoning-heavy — not just large.

## Prompt Templates

Use:
- `./implementer-prompt.md`
- `./spec-reviewer-prompt.md`
- `./code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md`

## Integration

- Setup workspace first with `using-git-worktrees`.
- Use `requesting-code-review` templates for quality review structure.
- Finish with `finishing-a-development-branch`.
